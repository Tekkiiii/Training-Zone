	<h2>History</h2>
	<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Training Zone have been the leader in all kinds of training that covers management and IT in Plongk St, Cairnsville for the last 150 years. <br>
	The founder of the company, Terrence Zonas is still CEO and spokesperson for Training Zone. <br>
	Here is one of his first ever training lessons, the world-famous Lecture Clash training:
Anyone got a lecture clash? They're not pretty, but with your help, they can be manageable. Here are some thoughts on how to deal with it: <br>
	
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•	Realise that it's up to you. You are responsible for making it work. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•	Attend one lecture and get the notes from the other (start with the web notes, but that's not enough). <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•	Find a friend in the one you miss and get them to tell you what else was covered in class that's not on the web. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•	Which one do you miss? - Some ideas to help you with that decision are: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o	If you miss one out of two lectures for a subject, that's 50%. If you miss one out of 3 that's 33%. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o	Which one are you most on top of? <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o	Which subject has the most complete lecture notes? <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•	Don't ask your lecturer - "did I miss anything in the lecture?" If you didn't miss anything, there'd be no point to lectures.<br>
